# Hoops Hype Studio (Starter Repo)

This is a skeleton starter for the **AI-powered basketball hype video** app.
Use `pnpm` (or `npm`) workspaces. Deploys on **Netlify**.

## Quick Start
1) Install deps (after you run `pnpm init` if needed):  
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```
2) Dev web:
   ```bash
   pnpm -C apps/web dev
   ```
3) Dev functions (from root):
   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```

> Note: This starter ships minimal code stubs and configs so an agent can fill in
> implementation details quickly (see `/docs` in your canvas for PRD + Codex guide).
